Each tech layer configuration object should have the following properties:

- `id`: electrification code;
- `label`: label for the electrification type;
- `color`: color hex code or gep color name* to be used on map and legend.

GEP defines specific color for default technologies. Although these can be changed it is not recommended as it may confuse the user.
